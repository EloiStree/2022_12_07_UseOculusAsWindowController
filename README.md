# 2022_12_07_UseOculusAsWindowController

The plan is to create code and an app that allows to use with OMI the Open XR Oculus version as a controller for Window.


Today, I received the Oculus Quest Pro controller. 
I did some code in the past that allows to stream the controller to an other app but it was not good as the Quest don't have large range for the controller and the Rift was a pain in the a** to setup.

So now I bought the controller and plan to do a link to my application OMI to be able to use it as window controller.

Feel free to ping me on this project in issue or discussion if you have question or want to participate.

(Start today 2022 12 07).
